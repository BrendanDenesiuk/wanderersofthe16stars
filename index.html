            The Wanderers of the 16 Stars (or Wot16S, for the sake of
            brevity) exists as Part 1 of my science fiction epic. Written
            for my 4th year grad/capstone project of my undergrad in
            Communication Design—Wot16S aims to investigate the
            extent to which expressive/unorthodox typographic &
            literary techniques can work in tandem to manipulate the
            way a reader experiences a text—using typography & layout
            to create a dynamic & almost cinematic experience on the
            page. The story was conceptualized as a long-form narrative,
            in which the various aspects of “breaking the text” build-
            up slowly overtime, allowing for their presence to act as a
            surprise to the reader.

            The narrative itself follows the aliens Trancolren, Leoca, &
            Tortallus, in their journey across the 16 stars of the Ethshad<sup>1</sup>.
            Part 1 follows the journey of Trancolren & Leoca across their
            home-world, The Twins of Skia: a pair of planets connected
            by a gargantuan pillar of water.
            <br><br>

            <br><br>
            The siblings notice strange environmental occurrences
            across their land: plants growing faster than usual, weather
            patterns shifting wildly, & the temperature of their local
            lake increasing rapidly. In their investigations of these
            strange happenings, they become the targets of two, crystal
            covered, gargantuan beasts, named Aviosyl & Ailphi

            Running parallel to the stories of Trancolren & Leoca, we follow Cameron Jade Joule, a
            (human) woman who works at a museum (at least, that’s what her boss would call it)
            that collects, categorizes, & archives alien artifacts. In reality, the “museum” is nothing
            more than the rich outcast’s collection of random junk & nonsense, labelled as alien
            artifacts; with everything from “UFO Parts” (random pieces of scrap metal) to “poetry”
            (nonsensical symbols scribbled onto dirty paper), to collections of weird, unreadable
            textbooks & brochures. Cameron goes along with the the “work” for nothing more than
            the shockingly good pay, spending her hours listening to weird albums she finds in the
            shelves of the warehouse & wondering why the hell her boss (Richard Francis Jareds
            III) bothers with this bizarre & seemingly worthless hobby.

            With the the assistance of some textbooks of unknown origin, she begins to translate it

            across the 16 Stars of the Ethshad. In this process, she leaves behind footnotes &
            interjections to assist readers with aspects of the story not yet explained by Trankolren.

            The typography within Wot16S allows for subtle perspective shifts, both within the same
            chapter & same paragraph, alongside cinematic treatments of page layouts, creating
            effects that are otherwise difficult to create (or at least, more difficult to visually express)
            through traditional writing.
            <br>
            &emsp; While Trankolren’s narrative takes advantage of an unorthodox two-column
            ragged-right layout (see the above image), Kameron’s sections of the text shift us to a
            single-column justified block. The unique aspect of Kameron’s chapters come from her
            own editing of her initial writings—for as she goes back to make modifications, we find
            that the the text itself is never deleted her original writings are never removed, but rather
            simply crossed-out, with her edits left marked in red. This creates pages that read like
            editor’s drafts, despite their completed design. The pairing of marked-up text with an
            overly formal layout helps to create an uneasy tension to her sections of the narrative
            for the reader, with segments that seem polished yet very unfinished.

                In Chapter 5, Trankolren and Lioka are plunged into a lake, taking refuge among the
                mud & murk of the lakebed as they attempt to hide themselves from the many peering
                eyes of Ailphi.
                <br><br>
                During this time, the detritus and debris of the water make it harder and harder for them
                to see, reflected through the fading of the text along the page.

                Throughout the text, we see instances of “mid-paragraph interjections”, in which our
                author, Trankolren, interjects his own paragraphs to elaborate on certain topics. As we
                continue throughout the story, however, these begin to shift from elaborations toward
                conversations between characters within the story, as if the characters are whispering to
                one another in the midst of acting out the events of the story.

                During Chapter 4, the columns are suddenly bisected by a horizontal bar of
                text—cutting through the middle of the page, & suddenly reflecting the perspective of
                Ailphi, rather than that of Trankolren.
                <br><br>
                This works as a dramatic setup for the future of the text, in which both Aviosyl and Ailphi
                will break into their own perspectives, cutting across the columns and pushing away
                other character’s text blocks to provide their own commentary on the unfolding events.

                In addition to the breaks of the two beasts, Lioka also finds herself breaking from the
                conventional rules of the text. At first, she merely shifts the perspectives of paragraphs
                from Trankolren to herself, potentially confusing the reader, &amp;/or making them think
                they’ve spotted a typo. Toward the end of the story, however, she manages to break
                free from Trankolren’s paragraphs, and creates her own layout, using skinnier text
                columns to separate her sections from his.

                entrusted with.

                In this moment, his mind, and the pages of the book, are thrown into overwhelming
                chaos, filling every inch of the page with endless strings of words, before breaking out
                into weird distortions and misplacements.

                As the story progresses, we transition from following Trankolren &amp; Lioka (and
                occasionally swapping to the perspectives of others) to entire chapters dedicated to the
                journey of Ailphi and Aviosyl. These chapters make use of the long text blocks setup
                back in Chapter 4.

                The chapter shown here also includes i-swork-gi crawling out from the page gutter,

            The illustrations within Wot16S are done in charcoal, with very rough line-work. These
            illustrations are created by Trankolren, penciled into his sketchbook and on various
            scraps of paper throughout the journey.
            <br><br>
            Sometimes these illustrations are used as full-page spreads, either transitioning the
            reader between chapters or acting as a sort of interlude, or they are embedded within
            pages in reference to current events or characters.

            In addition to these illustrations, we also have Kameron’s Doodles, which are left all
            throughout the book in various places, effectively acting as spot illustrations or
            references to various creatures & locations mentioned but not illustrated by Trankolren.
            These exist alongside her penned in notes, which o fill the margins of the text with her
            own thoughts.
            <br>
            These illustrations are also done in a rough style, the idea behind them being that,
            simply put, Kameron isn’t very good at drawing.

            &emsp; The examples of page spreads below showcase these doodles acting as spot
