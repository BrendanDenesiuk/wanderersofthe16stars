            The Wanderers of the 16 Stars (or Wot16S, for the sake of
            brevity) exists as Part 1 of my science fiction epic. Written
            for my 4th year grad/capstone project of my undergrad in
            Communication Design—Wot16S aims to investigate the
            extent to which expressive/unorthodox typographic &
            literary techniques can work in tandem to manipulate the
            way a reader experiences a text—using typography & layout
            to create a dynamic & almost cinematic experience on the
            page. The story was conceptualized as a long-form narrative,
            in which the various aspects of “breaking the text” build-
            up slowly overtime, allowing for their presence to act as a
            surprise to the reader.

            The narrative itself follows the aliens Trancolren, Leoca, &
            Tortallus, in their journey across the 16 stars of the Ethshad<sup>1</sup>.
            Part 1 follows the journey of Trancolren & Leoca across their
            home-world, The Twins of Skia: a pair of planets connected
            by a gargantuan pillar of water.
            <br><br>
            <em>1.  A word that refers to Space in Skekstion (the language of Trancolren & Leoca)</em>
            <br><br>
            The siblings notice strange environmental occurrences
            across their land: plants growing faster than usual, weather
            patterns shifting wildly, & the temperature of their local
            lake increasing rapidly. In their investigations of these
            strange happenings, they become the targets of two, crystal
            covered, gargantuan beasts, named Aviosyl & Ailphi

            Running parallel to the stories of Trancolren & Leoca, we follow Cameron Jade Joule, a
            (human) woman who works at a museum (at least, that’s what her boss would call it)
            that collects, categorizes, & archives alien artifacts. In reality, the “museum” is nothing
            more than the rich outcast’s collection of random junk & nonsense, labelled as alien
            artifacts; with everything from “UFO Parts” (random pieces of scrap metal) to “poetry”
            (nonsensical symbols scribbled onto dirty paper), to collections of weird, unreadable
            textbooks & brochures. Cameron goes along with the the “work” for nothing more than
            the shockingly good pay, spending her hours listening to weird albums she finds in the
            shelves of the warehouse & wondering why the hell her boss (Richard Francis Jareds
            III) bothers with this bizarre & seemingly worthless hobby.

            With the assistance of some textbooks of unknown origin, she begins to translate it
            into English from i-swork-gi<sup>2</sup>, & unravels the story of Trankolren, Leoka, & their journey
            across the 16 Stars of the Ethshad. In this process, she leaves behind footnotes &
            interjections to assist readers with aspects of the story not yet explained by Trankolren.

            The typography within Wot16S allows for subtle perspective shifts, both within the same
            chapter & same paragraph, alongside cinematic treatments of page layouts, creating
            effects that are otherwise difficult to create (or at least, more difficult to visually express)
            through traditional writing.
            <br>
            &emsp; While Trankolren’s narrative takes advantage of an unorthodox two-column
            ragged-right layout (see the above image), Kameron’s sections of the text shift us to a
            single-column justified block. The unique aspect of Kameron’s chapters come from her
            own editing of her initial writings—for as she goes back to make modifications, we find
            that the the text itself is never deleted her original writings are never removed, but rather
            simply crossed-out, with her edits left marked in red. This creates pages that read like
            editor’s drafts, despite their completed design. The pairing of marked-up text with an
            overly formal layout helps to create an uneasy tension to her sections of the narrative
            for the reader, with segments that seem polished yet very unfinished.

            Kameron's pages also emphasize aspects of her efforts to translate the text, with regard to the conventions of i-swork-gi.
